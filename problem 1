Problem 1
Name of the problem: Multiples of 3 and 5

Problem Description: "If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000."

//start code
var sumPrimes = function(num) {
  //sum variable that we will return at end 
  var sum = 0;
  
  //let's limit the thing to the num given
  //with a simple for loop from 0 -> num
  for(var x = 0; x <num; x++){
    
    // if x is evenly divisible by 3 or 5 add it to sum
    if(x % 5 === 0 || x % 3 === 0) {
      sum +=x;
    }
  }
  
  // return the final result
  return sum;
};

sumPrimes(1000);    //233168
//end code

//notes: I had some problems with the wording on this problem in that the original problem specified "all numbers below 1000," 
//which I interpreted as all numbers between 1-999 while the solution that they were looking for included 1000 as well.
